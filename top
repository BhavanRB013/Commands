top command 
	This command will provide the snapshot of current resources that are being used with 3 seconds (default)
	By clicking q we can quit out
	Top provides two division 
		1. statistics at top
		2. Process at bottom
*statistics at top

1st	shows load average and uptime.
	Load average refers to the working of cpu whether it is working 100% or not. If i have 4core cpu then my 100% will be 4.

2nd	statistics about how many task running in system memory
	a child process is a process which is start by another process press  shift+v to see this relation.
	the systemd is the one which creates other process 
	But a zombie process is when a child process finishes and wanted to free up the space and resources and need an instruction from parent
	process but let's say before giving an instruction to close the child process the parent get closed then the child process awaits for the
	process forever.

3rd	statistics about cpu. us refers to user space. sy refers to kernel space. ni refers to niceness which is altering scheduling priority on cpu
	id refers to idle the higher the idle value the less busy cpu is. wa refers to waiting tells about how many task are waiting for input.
	hi and si refers to hardware and software interrupts. st refers to how much time a virtual cpu has been waiting for the physical cpu.

4th	memory information

5th	swap information which is memory located on hard drive

*process table

	Here we can see PID(process id), USER, PR(priority), NI(niceness), VIRT(virtual memory used by task), RES(Physical memory used by task),
	SHR(shared memory), TIME (tells how much time cpu has spent on that particular task)

P	refers to sort the task with respect to CPU usage

M	sort the task with memory usage

k	to kill a process esc to back

d	gives delay we can set our own
